## 2\. Data Preprocessing

### ðŸ§ª Exercise: Data Preprocessing

Perform the following on a given dataset:

**1. Handle Missing Values**

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Forward fill
df.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)
# or Drop missing rows
df.dropna(inplace=True)
```

**2. Encoding Categorical Variables**

```python
# One-hot encoding
df = pd.get_dummies(df, columns=['Gender', 'Country'])

# Label encoding
from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
le = LabelEncoder()
df['Category'] = le.fit_transform(df['Category'])
```

**3. Feature Scaling (Normalize / Standardize)**

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler

scaler = MinMaxScaler()
df[['Age', 'Salary']] = scaler.fit_transform(df[['Age', 'Salary']])
```

**4. Splitting Dataset**

```python
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

X = df.drop('Target', axis=1)
y = df['Target']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
```

### âœ… Quiz

#### 1\. Explain different ways of handling missing values.

  * **Deletion**: Remove rows (`df.dropna()`) or columns with missing data. Used when missing data is minimal.
  * **Imputation**: Fill missing values using:
      * **Mean/Median/Mode**: `df.fillna(df['Column'].mean())`
      * **Forward/Backward Fill**: Propagate previous/next values.
      * **Model-based Imputation**: Use regression or k-NN to predict missing values.

#### 2\. What is categorical data? Explain its types with examples.

**Categorical Data** refers to variables that represent categories instead of numerical values.

  * **Nominal**: No order or ranking.
      * *Example*: Gender (Male, Female), Color (Red, Blue)
  * **Ordinal**: Has an inherent order.
      * *Example*: Education Level (High School \< Bachelor's \< Master's), Ratings (Low, Medium, High)

```

### âœ… Quiz

#### 1\. What is Simple Linear Regression?

Simple Linear Regression is a statistical method used to model the relationship between a single independent variable ($X$) and a dependent variable ($Y$) by fitting a straight line ($Y = mX + c$) through the data.

  * It assumes a **linear relationship** between variables.
  * *Example*: Predicting salary based on years of experience.

#### 2\. How can we take care of outliers in data?

  * **Detection:**
      * **Statistical Tests:** Z-score, IQR method
      * **Visualization:** Box plot, scatter plot
  * **Handling:**
      * **Remove Outliers:** If they're errors or rare, drop them.
      * **Transform Data:** Use log or square root transformations to reduce impact.
      * **Imputation:** Replace outliers with a robust measure like the median.
      * **Use Robust Models:** Models like RANSAC are less sensitive to outliers.

```

### âœ… Quiz

#### 1\. What is Support Vector Machine (SVM)?

Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression. It works by finding the optimal **hyperplane** that best separates data points of different classes in a high-dimensional space.

#### 2\. What are Support Vectors and Hyperplane in SVM?

  * **Support Vectors**: These are the critical data points closest to the separating hyperplane. They directly influence the position and orientation of the hyperplane.
  * **Hyperplane**: It's the decision boundary that separates classes. In 2D, itâ€™s a line; in 3D, a plane; and in higher dimensions, a hyperplane.

#### 3\. What are the factors determining the effectiveness of SVM?

1.  **Kernel Choice**: Linear, Polynomial, RBF (Radial Basis Function), etc.
2.  **Regularization Parameter ($C$)**: Controls the trade-off between maximizing the margin and minimizing classification error.
3.  **Gamma ($\\gamma$)**: Defines how far the influence of a single training example reaches (used in RBF/poly kernels).
4.  **Feature Scaling**: SVMs are sensitive to feature scalesâ€”standardization often improves performance.

### ðŸ§ª Exercise: Implement k-Means Clustering

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load dataset (replace with your file)
df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Select relevant numeric columns
X = df[['Feature1', 'Feature2']] # Replace with your feature names

# Feature scaling is important for k-means
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Fit k-means (change n_clusters as needed)
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3, random_state=42, n_init=10)
kmeans.fit(X_scaled)

# Add cluster labels to the dataframe
df['Cluster'] = kmeans.labels_

# Plot clusters (for 2D features)
plt.scatter(X_scaled[:, 0], X_scaled[:, 1], c=kmeans.labels_, cmap='viridis')
plt.scatter(kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 0], kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 1],
            color='red', marker='x', label='Centroids')
plt.title('k-Means Clustering')
plt.xlabel('Feature 1 (Scaled)')
plt.ylabel('Feature 2 (Scaled)')
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### âœ… Quiz

#### 1\. What is Clustering?

Clustering is an **unsupervised learning** technique that groups similar data points into **clusters** based on their features, without predefined labels. It aims to ensure that points within a cluster are more similar to each other than to those in other clusters.

#### 2\. What is the k-means algorithm?

**k-Means** is a popular clustering algorithm that partitions a dataset into **$k$ clusters** by minimizing the variance within each cluster.

1.  Choose the number of clusters, $k$.
2.  Randomly initialize $k$ centroids.
3.  Assign each data point to its nearest centroid.
4.  Update centroids by calculating the mean of all points assigned to them.
5.  Repeat steps 3â€“4 until the centroids no longer change.

#### 3\. Applications of Unsupervised Learning in Engineering

  * **Anomaly Detection**: Identifying faulty equipment in manufacturing.
  * **Customer Segmentation**: Grouping users for targeted marketing.
  * **Image Compression**: Reducing image size by clustering colors.
  * **Network Traffic Analysis**: Discovering intrusion patterns.

## 6\. K-Fold Cross Validation

### ðŸ§ª Exercise: Implement K-Fold Cross Validation

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from sklearn.model_selection import KFold, cross_val_score
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression # Example model
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Load dataset (replace with your file)
df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Define features (X) and target (y)
X = df.drop('target', axis=1) # Replace 'target' with your target column
y = df['target']

# Scale features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Initialize model
model = LogisticRegression()

# Set up K-Fold Cross Validation (k=5)
kf = KFold(n_splits=5, shuffle=True, random_state=42)
scores = cross_val_score(model, X_scaled, y, cv=kf, scoring='accuracy')

# Results
print(f"Scores for each fold: {scores}")
print(f"Average Accuracy: {np.mean(scores):.2f}")
```

### âœ… Quiz

#### 1\. What is K-Fold Cross Validation?

**K-Fold Cross Validation** is a model evaluation technique where the dataset is divided into **$k$ equal parts (folds)**. The model is trained on **$k-1$ folds** and tested on the remaining fold. This process is repeated **$k$ times**, with each fold used exactly once as the test set.

#### 2\. What is the need for K-Fold Cross Validation?

  * **Reliable Performance Estimate**: Gives a more robust estimate of model performance than a single train/test split.
  * **Reduces Overfitting Concern**: By testing on multiple different subsets, it ensures the model generalizes well.
  * **Efficient Data Usage**: All data points are used for both training and validation.

## 7\. Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

### ðŸ§ª Exercise: Implement PCA

```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Load dataset (replace with your dataset)
df = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

# Separate features (and target, if present)
X = df.drop('target', axis=1, errors='ignore')

# Standardize features
scaler = StandardScaler()
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

# Apply PCA (reduce to 2 components for visualization)
pca = PCA(n_components=2)
X_pca = pca.fit_transform(X_scaled)

# Create DataFrame of principal components
pca_df = pd.DataFrame(data=X_pca, columns=['PC1', 'PC2'])

# Plot the results
plt.figure(figsize=(8, 6))
plt.scatter(pca_df['PC1'], pca_df['PC2'])
plt.title('PCA Result')
plt.xlabel('Principal Component 1')
plt.ylabel('Principal Component 2')
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```

### âœ… Quiz

#### 1\. What is Dimensionality Reduction?

Dimensionality Reduction is the process of reducing the number of input variables (features) in a dataset while preserving as much important information (variance) as possible. It is used to:

  * Eliminate redundant or correlated features.
  * Reduce computational cost and training time.
  * Improve model performance and avoid overfitting.
  * Visualize high-dimensional data in 2D/3D.

#### 2\. Explain PCA Algorithm

PCA is a technique for dimensionality reduction that transforms correlated features into a new set of uncorrelated features called **principal components**.

  * The first principal component captures the maximum variance in the data.
  * Each subsequent component is orthogonal to the previous ones and captures the maximum remaining variance.

## 8\. Association Rule Mining (Apriori)

### ðŸ§ª Exercise: Implement Apriori Algorithm

```python
# !pip install mlxtend
import pandas as pd
from mlxtend.frequent_patterns import apriori, association_rules

# The dataset must be in a one-hot encoded format
# Example data:
data = {'Milk': [1, 0, 1, 1, 0],
        'Bread': [1, 1, 0, 1, 1],
        'Butter': [0, 1, 1, 0, 1],
        'Jam': [0, 1, 0, 0, 0]}
df = pd.DataFrame(data)

# Apply Apriori to find frequent itemsets
frequent_itemsets = apriori(df, min_support=0.3, use_colnames=True)

# Generate association rules
rules = association_rules(frequent_itemsets, metric="confidence", min_threshold=0.6)

# Show results
print("Frequent Itemsets:")
print(frequent_itemsets)
print("\nAssociation Rules:")
print(rules[['antecedents', 'consequents', 'support', 'confidence', 'lift']])
```

### âœ… Quiz

#### 1\. What is Association Rule Mining?

**Association Rule Mining** is a technique used to find relationships or patterns between items in large datasets. It is commonly used in **market basket analysis**.

  * *Example*: If a customer buys bread and butter, they are likely to buy jam. This is represented as the rule `{Bread, Butter} â‡’ {Jam}`.

#### 2\. Explain Apriori Algorithm

The **Apriori Algorithm** is used for mining frequent itemsets and deriving association rules. It operates on the principle that if an itemset is frequent, then all of its subsets must also be frequent.

  * **Support**: Frequency of an itemset in the dataset.
  * **Confidence**: How often a rule is found to be true ($P(Y|X)$).
  * **Lift**: How much more likely the consequent is, given the antecedent ($Confidence(Xâ‡’Y) / Support(Y)$).

## 9\. Reinforcement Learning & Thompson Sampling

### ðŸ§ª Exercise: Implement Thompson Sampling

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Multi-Armed Bandit Problem Setup
n_rounds = 1000
n_arms = 5 # Number of options (e.g., ad versions)
true_probabilities = [0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 0.3] # True success rates of each arm

# Initialize counts for Beta distribution (prior)
successes = np.zeros(n_arms)
failures = np.zeros(n_arms)

selections = []

# Simulation loop
for _ in range(n_rounds):
    # Sample from the Beta distribution for each arm
    theta = [np.random.beta(successes[i] + 1, failures[i] + 1) for i in range(n_arms)]
    
    # Choose the arm with the highest sampled probability
    chosen_arm = np.argmax(theta)
    selections.append(chosen_arm)
    
    # Simulate reward based on the true probability
    reward = np.random.binomial(1, true_probabilities[chosen_arm])
    
    # Update successes/failures for the chosen arm
    if reward == 1:
        successes[chosen_arm] += 1
    else:
        failures[chosen_arm] += 1

# Plot number of times each arm was selected
plt.bar(range(n_arms), [selections.count(i) for i in range(n_arms)])
plt.xlabel('Arm')
plt.ylabel('Number of Times Selected')
plt.title('Thompson Sampling Selections')
plt.show()
```

### âœ… Quiz

#### 1\. Enlist main elements of a Reinforcement Learning (RL) system.

  * **Agent**: The learner or decision-maker.
  * **Environment**: The external system the agent interacts with.
  * **State ($S$)**: The current situation or observation.
  * **Action ($A$)**: A choice the agent can make.
  * **Reward ($R$)**: Feedback from the environment after an action.
  * **Policy ($\\pi$)**: The agent's strategy for choosing actions.

#### 2\. Explain Thompson Sampling algorithm.

**Thompson Sampling** is a probabilistic algorithm for balancing **exploration** and **exploitation** in multi-armed bandit problems. It maintains a probability distribution for the expected reward of each arm. In each round, it samples a value from each arm's distribution and chooses the arm with the highest sample. This naturally balances trying out uncertain but potentially better arms (exploration) with choosing the current best-known arm (exploitation).

#### 1\. Difference between Machine Learning and Deep Learning

| Feature | Machine Learning | Deep Learning |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Algorithms** | Traditional algorithms like SVM, Decision Trees, Regression. | Uses multi-layered Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). |
| **Feature Extraction**| Requires manual feature engineering from domain experts. | Automatically learns features from raw data. |
| **Data Requirement**| Performs well on small to medium-sized datasets. | Excels with very large datasets. |
| **Computation**| Less computationally intensive. | Requires high computational power, often GPUs. |

#### 2\. Briefly Explain Perceptron and Mention Its Limitation

  * **Perceptron**: It is the simplest type of artificial neural network, consisting of a single neuron. It takes multiple binary inputs, computes a weighted sum, and applies a step function to produce a single binary output.
  * **Limitation**: Its primary limitation is that it can only solve **linearly separable** problems. It cannot model complex, non-linear relationships, famously failing on the **XOR problem**.
